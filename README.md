<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Nowadays everyone is trying to build or break a habit. But it's tricky to keep track of them. Identify a habit you'd like to help someone break or build (e.g. alcohol consumption, smoking, calories, exercise, healthy eating...) and make an app to help.
* Make CRUD entries on the front-end that are persisted on a MongoDB database on the back-end
* Display the data in visually interesting / insightful ways.

Habit to track: Home-cooked-meal frequency and mindfulness.

The App can:

# MVP
A user should be able to:

* Search the API for recipe ideas (view some)
* Select a recipe (view one)
* Add a meal to their "Cooked Meals" (add a recipe, date and opinion)
* Remove a meal from their "Cooked Meals"
* View a chart that shows the frequency of home-cooked-meals and any notes the user added


# Extensions
* Add a 'next page' to the search results 
* Be able to add a recipe to a favourite recipe list for later use
* Split total meals into a daily meal list


# Responsibilities
# Helen
* Understand and connect to the API
* Render out the results from the API using a flip card visual
