# Habit Tracker brief
Nowadays everyone is trying to build or break a habit. But it's tricky to keep track of them. Identify a habit you'd like to help someone break or build (e.g. alcohol consumption, smoking, calories, exercise, healthy eating...) and make an app to help.
* Make CRUD entries on the front-end that are persisted on a MongoDB database on the back-end
* Display the data in visually interesting / insightful ways.

Habit to track: Home-cooked-meal frequency and mindfulness.
