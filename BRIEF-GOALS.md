# Habit Tracker brief
Nowadays everyone is trying to build or break a habit. But it's tricky to keep track of them. Identify a habit you'd like to help someone break or build (e.g. alcohol consumption, smoking, calories, exercise, healthy eating...) and make an app to help.
* Make CRUD entries on the front-end that are persisted on a MongoDB database on the back-end
* Display the data in visually interesting / insightful ways.


Tracking home-cooked-meal frequency and mindfulness.

# MVP
A user should be able to:

* See a list of all recipe options (view all)
* Select a recipe (view one)
* Add a meal to their "Cooked Meals" (add a recipe, date and opinion)
* Remove a meal from their "Cooked Meals"
* View a chart that shows the frequency of home-cooked-meals


# Extensions
* Add in a recipe list using an API
* Split total meals into a daily meal list
* When a meal is added to the user's database, a date must be added (date.now)
